# Odd or Even?

Today, we're going to do a simple input and test program. Your program will ask the user for a number, then it will tell them if it's odd or even.

Hint: If the number is divisible by 2, it's even.

Another Hint: Modulo arithmetic is STILL your friend!

No template for this one. Just write the code...
